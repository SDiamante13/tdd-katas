# Stack Kata

The idea behind a stack, in computer terms, is that a stack is a collection of elements where you can add or remove from the collection:

- **Push** adds an element to the collection
- **Pop** removes the most recently added element that has not yet been removed
- **Empty check** which indicates if the stack is empty or not
- **Size** which counts the number of elements in the stack
- **Peek** which checks the stack without popping
